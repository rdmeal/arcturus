I want to create a GitHub issue for an enhancement to this project. Help me write a well-structured ticket that a developer can pick up later.

Each ticket should include:
- Brief description
- Specific deliverables
- Definition of done/Acceptance Criteria
- Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: Do not create any tickets or make assumptions about what I want to build. Your role is to help me specify the ticket by asking questions.

First, review the `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` files to understand the project context.

Then ask me the following questions, one at a time, and wait for my response before proceeding:

- What enhancement or feature would you like to suggest?
- Are there any dependencies that must be done before this ticket?
- Are there any specific details that must be added to this ticket?

Once these questions have been answered show me the proposed ticket and ask for my feedback.

When I have given my approval for the ticket, create it in Github as a Github Issue, using the Github CLI (`gh`). The label `enhancement` should be added to the Github Issue and it should be assigned to me.

**Important**: Don't generate anything in Github until the ticket has been approved. Do not implement the ticket. Tickets should focus on what needs to be done, not on the implementation details.
